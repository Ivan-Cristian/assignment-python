* Run this once youâ€™re done to ensure Homebrew is installed and working properly:

`brew doctor`

* Now you can install Python 3.5 like this:

`brew install python3`

* If pip is not installed, you can install it using:

`sudo easy_install pip`

* If you prefer pip, then use the following command:

`sudo pip install selenium`

* Install behave:

`sudo pip install behave`

###Running the tests:

* Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Ivan-Cristian/assignment-python.git`

* From within the base directory, run behave:

`behave`

** You can run the test based on the feature file or tag:
